        <h4>WHAT IS HTML?</h4>      
        
        <img class="img-responsive" src="photo/htmlcode.jpg" alt="what is html">
        
        <p>Html is just like the skeleton of a website.</p>

        <p>HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. HTML gives authors the means to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.</li>
          <li>Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.</li>
          <li>Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for.</li>
          <li>information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.</li>
          <li>Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.</li>
        </ul> 
      
      

      <div class="">
          <h4>WHAT IS CSS?</h4>
  
        <img class="img-responsive" src="photo/cssbest.jpg" alt="what is CSS">  
          
          <p>Css is just like the flesh and clothes that covers the skeleton and beautifies the body.</p>
          
          <p>CSS cascading is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. Cascading style sheet is responsible for what we see on our screen and thus play a central role in website design and development.
        
        </p><p>CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="">
        <h4>Benefits of CSS in Web Development</h4>
        <p class="subhead">Improves Website Presentation</p>

        <p>The standout advantage of CSS is the added design flexibility and interactivity it brings to web development. Developers have greater control over the layout allowing them to make precise section-wise changes.</p>

        <p class="subhead">Makes Updates Easier and Smoother</p>

        <p>CSS works by creating rules. These rules are simultaneously applied to multiple elements within the site. Eliminating the repetitive coding style of HTML makes development work faster and less monotonous. Errors are also reduced considerably.
        Helps Web Pages Load Faster
        Improved website loading is an underrated yet important benefit of CSS.
        
        <p>Browsers download the CSS rules once and cache them for loading all the pages of a website. It makes browsing the website faster and enhances the overall user experience.
        This feature comes in handy in making websites work smoothly at lower internet speeds. Accessibility on low end devices also improves with better loading speeds.</p>

          <h4>WHAT IS BOOTSTRAP?</h4>
        
        <img class="img-responsive" src="photo/bootstrap.jpg" alt="what is bootstrap">

        <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications.</p>

        <p>Bootstrap is a front-end, open source application that ease the work you need to do in writing the codes of css. It saves you time and fasten your works.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="">
        <h4>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HTML, CSS And bootstrap?</h4>
        
        <img class="img-responsive" src="photo/hbc.jpg" alt="relationship between html and css">
        
        <p>HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for a variety of devices. Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSS are the basis of building Web pages and Web Applications.</p>   
        
        <p>Sincerely, you can create your website with only html but it will look as ugly and scary as when you see a human skeleton approaching you.</p>
        
        <p>And as for CSS-imagine how the skeleton looks like without the flesh.</p>
        
        <p>What about bootstrap?<br>
        Imagine you washing 100 clothes everyday using 12 hours when you can do that with washing machine for just 2 hours.</p>

      <div class="">
        <h4>WHAT IS DOMAIN NAME</h4>

        <img src="photo/getdomain.jpg" alt="how to get a domain name">
        
        <p>Domain name is essentially your starting point. You know it as www.whatever.com. Your domain name is “whatever.” You need to find something that no one else has, then register it before someone else does. It is your unique identity.

        <p>There are mostly two common domain designations; .com and .net. A third common designation of .org is mostly for non profit organizations. We DO NOT recommend .biz, .info, or other such domains in most cases. A few other words of advice are:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>If possible, try to avoid being too close to someone else (e.g. someone already has “whatever” so you choose “what-ever”). Yes, they will be different, but you may lose traffic if someone forgets the hyphen, plus, the other whatever will not be happy with you.</li>
          <li>Consider registering your domain name under both .com and .net if they are both available. You do not have to build web sites for both, but it's a good idea to register both to prevent someone else from capitalizing on your name later.</li>
          <li>If there are common misspellings of the domain name you want to use, it is a good idea to register those if they are available. In many cases, someone might be prone to use a plural version of a word where your domain might be singular. If possible, registering all variations is a good idea, and they can all be redirected to your real web site under your preferred domain name.</li>
          <li>DO NOT perform a search to see if the domain name(s) you want is/are available until you are ready to buy immediately! If you try to buy an available domain name later after a search, it could magically become unavailable or considerably more expensive.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="">
        <h4>Domain Registration</h4>

        <img src="photo/domainreg.jpg" alt="domain registration">

        <p>There are numerous contractors to provide this service and all of them deal with a single source called InterNIC. Once your registration is approved, you own worldwide rights to your domain name. Lease is actually a better term, you initially start with 1-10 years, then renew it before it expires. You can anticipate a cost of about $12 per year. You can usually register your domain name through the hosting service you choose (see next section below), but it's a good idea to use separate sources for each service.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="">
        <h4>Web Site Hosting</h4>

        <img src="photo/what is web hosting.jpg" alt="web hosting">

        <p>What is hosting? Simply put, when you have a web site developed, you will need a hosting service to make it available to all Internet users. This is not the same as an Internet Service Provider (ISP), but many ISP's do provide hosting. ISP's provide access to the Internet itself, hosting makes your web site accessible on the Internet. The quality, service, capabilities and even costs of hosting differ greatly.</p>

        <p>It is not our purpose here to endorse any particular service or provide a spec sheet for choosing one. Every situation is different, but here are some of the things you need to have addressed in making that decision:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Servers (special computers) are the means by which visitors access a hosted web site, your web site. A hosting service needs to be powerful enough to handle your traffic without sluggishness and sending your visitors away due to frustration. Back-up servers should also be used.</li>
          <li>Do they allow direct access to make changes and updates? We feel this one is very important.</li>
          <li>Do they support all the features you will want to have on your web site?</li>
          </li>There has been a proliferation of cheap hosting in the market. We do not recommend making your hosting choice based on price alone. Something has to give to provide this, and very often, one of those things is security. Poor security is a risk you cannot afford.</li>
          <li>We recommend using a hosting company with a long history and good customer satisfaction that can be verified. Poor customer service is all too common in the hosting business.</li>
        </ol>
