        <p>You having the knowledge of web development is not just to design web on your own it is also as good as having a handiwork.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>As we all know the common handwork in Nigeria are tailoring, hairdressing, mechanic, barber etc. a whole lot of people are already into this and it is choked up that there is no more room to make tangible money due to huge competition as you will see nothing less than 3 – 4 hairdressers, barbers or tailors in one street of Lagos especially.</p>

        <p>No wonder a lot of these people won’t cease complaining, languishing in financial crisis. Same is going on with a lot out there they want to learn handwork and they don’t know the right path to follow all because they never knew or could it be ignorance?

        <p>As a web developer you can’t be broke as long as you are creative your check keeps rolling in every day.</p>

        <h4>SOURCE OF INCOME</h4>

        <img src="photo/source of income.jpg" alt="earn income online" class="img-responsive">

        <p class="subhead">Last year I made close to $50,000 dollars I am still on loose for more this year.</p>

        <p>I got income from my sites, yes siteS NOT site there are lot ways and methods of making legitimate money online with your website (that is if you have any) one of them is freelancing - last week i got over $80 dollars through fiverr from 5 clients the most thrilling part is that I still earn from the part-time jobs I do! (I love money you'll say My fault?) you see I use just one stone to kill a lot of birds NO! Money (I am not getting birds in my account).</p>

        <p>Have family members who are going to get you gifts or advice you to learn handwork? Ask them to invest in a proper website design course for you.</p>

        <p>To be sincere, if I had learn tailoring or barbing or hairdressing I wouldn’t have gotten this much in a short time and still have time for myself. Most of my friends are now coming back to me to learn web development.</p>
